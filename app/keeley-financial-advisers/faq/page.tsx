        {
          question: "What does a financial adviser do?",
          answer:
            "A financial adviser helps you make informed decisions about your money. At Keeley & Co, we analyse your current financial situation, understand your goals, and create personalised strategies for investments, pensions, life planning, and protection. We also provide ongoing support and adjust your plan as your circumstances change.",
        },
        {
          question: "Why should I use an independent financial adviser?",
          answer:
            "Independent financial advisers (IFAs) like Keeley & Co are not tied to any product provider. This means we can recommend the best solutions from the entire market, rather than being limited to a specific company's products. Our advice is based solely on what's best for you.",
        },
        {
          question: "Are you regulated?",
          answer:
            "Yes, Keeley & Co is authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This means we adhere to strict professional standards, and you're protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) and have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service if needed.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do you offer a free initial consultation?",
          answer:
            "Yes, we offer a complimentary initial consultation with no obligation. This meeting allows us to understand your situation and goals, while you can get to know us and decide if we're the right fit for your needs. There's no pressure to proceed with any paid services.",
        },
        {
          question: "What is a Chartered Financial Planner?",
          answer:
            "Chartered Financial Planner is the gold standard qualification in financial planning, awarded by the Chartered Insurance Institute. It demonstrates the highest level of professional competence, ethical standards, and commitment to continuing professional development. Luella Keeley holds this prestigious designation.",

    {
      category: "Investment & Wealth Management",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "What is the minimum investment amount you work with?",
          answer:
            "We work with clients across a range of investment sizes. We're happy to discuss your situation as every client is different. Whether you're looking to invest a lump sum or make regular contributions, we can help you find the right approach.",
        },
        {
          question: "How do you determine my risk profile?",
          answer:
            "We use a comprehensive risk assessment process that considers your investment objectives, time horizon, financial situation, and attitude to risk. This involves detailed discussions and questionnaires to ensure we truly understand your comfort level with investment volatility.",
        },
        {
          question: "Can you help with ethical or sustainable investments?",
          answer:
            "Absolutely. We offer a range of ethical, sustainable, and ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investment options. We can build a portfolio that aligns with your values without compromising on your financial objectives.",
        },
        {
          question: "How often will my investments be reviewed?",
          answer:
            "We typically conduct formal annual reviews, though we monitor portfolios continuously. You're welcome to contact us at any time if your circumstances change or you have questions. For wealth management clients, we may meet more frequently depending on your needs.",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      category: "Pensions",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "Should I consolidate my old pensions?",
          answer:
            "It depends on your individual circumstances. Consolidating multiple pensions can make management easier and potentially reduce charges, but it's not always the right choice. Some older pensions have valuable benefits that would be lost on transfer. We'll analyse all your pensions and recommend the best approach for you.",
        },
        {
          question: "What is pension drawdown?",
          answer:
            "Pension drawdown allows you to take flexible income from your pension while keeping the rest invested. This gives you more control than buying an annuity, but requires careful management. We can advise on the most suitable income strategy for your retirement.",
        },
        {
          question: "Can you help with my company pension scheme?",
          answer:
            "Yes, we advise on all types of pension schemes including workplace pensions, SIPPs, and defined benefit (final salary) schemes. We can help you understand your options and make the best decisions for your retirement.",
        },
        {
          question: "When should I start pension planning?",
          answer:
            "The earlier the better! Thanks to compound growth, starting pension contributions in your 20s or 30s can make a huge difference to your retirement pot. However, it's never too late to start, and we can help you maximise your pension savings at any age.",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      category: "Life Planning",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "What is life planning and how is it different from financial planning?",
          answer:
            "Life planning goes beyond traditional financial planning by starting with your life goals rather than your finances. We help you identify what truly matters to you — whether that's early retirement, travel, family, or leaving a legacy — then build a financial strategy that supports those priorities.",
        },
        {
          question: "How can life planning help me?",
          answer:
            "Life planning helps ensure your money serves your life, not the other way around. By clarifying your priorities, we can create a roadmap that brings your aspirations within reach, giving you confidence that you're on the right track and making the most of your resources.",

    {
      category: "Protection & Insurance",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "Do I need life insurance?",
          answer:
            "If anyone depends on your income, life insurance is essential. It ensures your family can maintain their lifestyle, pay the mortgage, and meet financial goals if you pass away. We'll assess your needs and find appropriate cover at competitive rates.",
        },
        {
          question: "What is critical illness cover?",
          answer:
            "Critical illness cover pays a tax-free lump sum if you're diagnosed with a specified serious illness, such as cancer, heart attack, or stroke. This can help cover medical costs, adapt your home, or simply provide financial security during recovery.",
        },
        {
          question: "Can you help with general insurance as well?",
          answer:
            "Yes, in addition to life insurance and protection, we can also advise on general insurance needs including home, motor, and business insurance. We ensure you have the right cover in place at competitive rates.",
        },

    },
    {
      category: "Fees & Charges",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "How do you charge for your services?",
          answer:
            "We offer both fee-based and commission-based options depending on the service. Our fees are always explained clearly upfront before any work begins. Initial consultations are free, and we'll provide a detailed fee agreement before proceeding with any recommendations.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do I pay for the initial meeting?",
          answer:
            "No, your initial consultation is completely free and without obligation. We use this meeting to understand your needs and explain how we can help. You'll only incur fees if you decide to proceed with our advice and services.",
        },
        {
          question: "Are there any hidden charges?",
          answer:
            "Absolutely not. Transparency is one of our core values — and has been since 1928. All fees and charges, including any product costs, will be clearly explained in writing before you commit to anything. You'll always know exactly what you're paying for.",
