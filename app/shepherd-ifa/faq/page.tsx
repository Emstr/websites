        {
          question: "What does a financial adviser do?",
          answer:
            "A financial adviser helps you make informed decisions about your money. We analyse your current financial situation, understand your goals, and create personalised strategies for pensions, investments, mortgages, and protection. We also provide ongoing support and adjust your plan as your circumstances change.",
        },
        {
          question: "Why should I use an independent financial adviser?",
          answer:
            "Independent financial advisers (IFAs) like Shepherd IFA are not tied to any product provider. This means we can recommend the best solutions from the entire market, rather than being limited to a specific company's products. Our advice is based solely on what's best for you.",
        },
        {
          question: "Are you regulated?",
          answer:
            "Yes, Shepherd Independent Financial Advisers Limited is directly authorised and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). This means we adhere to strict professional standards, and you're protected by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) and have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service if needed.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do you offer a free initial consultation?",
          answer:
            "Yes, we offer a complimentary initial consultation with no obligation. This meeting allows us to understand your situation and goals, while you can get to know Jane and Paul and decide if we're the right fit for your needs. There's no pressure to proceed with any paid services.",
        },
        {
          question: "Will I always deal with the same adviser?",
          answer:
            "Yes. As a family firm run by Jane and Paul Shepherd, you'll always deal directly with one of us. We don't have a team of junior advisers or a call centre — you get personal, consistent service from start to finish.",
        },
      ],
    },
    {
      category: "Pensions & Retirement",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "Should I consolidate my old pensions?",
          answer:
            "It depends on your individual circumstances. Consolidating multiple pensions can make management easier and potentially reduce charges, but it's not always the right choice. Some older pensions have valuable benefits that would be lost on transfer. We'll analyse all your pensions and recommend the best approach for you.",
        },
        {
          question: "What is pension drawdown?",
          answer:
            "Pension drawdown allows you to take flexible income from your pension while keeping the rest invested. This gives you more control than buying an annuity, but requires careful management. We can advise on the most suitable income strategy for your retirement.",
        },
        {
          question: "When should I start pension planning?",
          answer:
            "The earlier the better! Thanks to compound growth, starting pension contributions in your 20s or 30s can make a huge difference to your retirement pot. However, it's never too late to start, and we can help you maximise your pension savings at any age.",
        },

    {
      category: "Investments",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "What is the minimum investment amount you work with?",
          answer:
            "We're happy to discuss your situation regardless of the amount. We work with clients who have lump sums to invest as well as those making regular monthly contributions. Every situation is different, and we'll always be upfront about whether our advice is likely to be worthwhile for your circumstances.",
        },
        {
          question: "How do you determine my risk profile?",
          answer:
            "We use a comprehensive risk assessment process that considers your investment objectives, time horizon, financial situation, and attitude to risk. This involves detailed discussions and questionnaires to ensure we truly understand your comfort level with investment volatility.",
        },
        {
          question: "How often will my investments be reviewed?",
          answer:
            "We typically conduct formal annual reviews, though we monitor portfolios continuously. You're welcome to contact us at any time if your circumstances change or you have questions.",
        },
      ],

    {
      category: "Mortgages",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "Can you help first-time buyers?",
          answer:
            "Absolutely. We love helping first-time buyers get on the property ladder. We'll search the whole mortgage market to find you the best deal, guide you through the application process, and make sure you have the right protection in place too.",
        },
        {
          question: "When should I think about remortgaging?",
          answer:
            "It's worth reviewing your mortgage when your current deal is coming to an end, when interest rates change significantly, or if your circumstances have changed. We can help you compare options and find a better deal if one exists.",
        },
        {
          question: "Do you charge for mortgage advice?",
          answer:
            "Our fee structure for mortgage advice will be explained clearly upfront. In many cases, we receive a commission from the lender, which means there's no direct fee to you. We'll always be transparent about how we're paid.",
        },
      ],

    {
      category: "Protection & Insurance",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "Do I need life insurance?",
          answer:
            "If anyone depends on your income, life insurance is essential. It ensures your family can maintain their lifestyle, pay the mortgage, and meet financial goals if you pass away. We'll assess your needs and find appropriate cover at competitive rates.",
        },
        {
          question: "What is critical illness cover?",
          answer:
            "Critical illness cover pays a tax-free lump sum if you're diagnosed with a specified serious illness, such as cancer, heart attack, or stroke. This can help cover medical costs, adapt your home, or simply provide financial security during recovery.",
        },
      ],

    {
      category: "Fees & Charges",
      questions: [
        {
          question: "How do you charge for your services?",
          answer:
            "We offer both fee-based and commission-based options depending on the service. Our fees are always explained clearly upfront before any work begins. Initial consultations are free, and we'll provide a detailed fee agreement before proceeding with any recommendations.",
        },
        {
          question: "Are there any hidden charges?",
          answer:
            "Absolutely not. Transparency is one of our core values. All fees and charges, including any product costs, will be clearly explained in writing before you commit to anything. You'll always know exactly what you're paying for.",
