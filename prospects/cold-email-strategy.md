## The Core Truth

The #1 mistake web design agencies make in cold email: **making it about themselves.**

"We're a full-service web design studio with 5 years of experience..."
→ Deleted immediately.

The goal is not to pitch. The goal is to **make the prospect feel seen** — like someone actually looked at their specific business and noticed something real. Everything else follows from that.

---

## The Approach That Works: Show, Don't Tell

The highest-performing web design cold email approaches all share one thing: they **deliver value before asking for anything.**

Three proven formats, ranked by results:

### 1. The Live Demo (our approach — highest leverage)

Build a real working version of their site. Send them the link cold.

> "Why waste your time with me telling you what I can do, when I can just show you?"

This is the most powerful version of "show don't tell" because it's not a mockup or a screenshot — it's a real website they can click around. The investment of time signals confidence and quality. It answers every question before they ask it.

**How to do it well:**
- Use the prospect's real name, location, services, and imagery
- Make sure all nav links work (routes within the demo should function)
- Use their brand colours if visible on their current site
- Don't make it perfect — make it obviously better than what they have

### 2. The Loom Audit Video

Record a 2-3 minute screen walkthrough of their actual website, narrating specific problems.

The key: **don't ask for a call in the first email.** Ask if you can send the video.

> "I put together a quick 3-minute video looking at [Company]'s site. No pitch — just a few things I noticed. Happy to send it over if useful?"

When they reply "yes, send it" — that reply is an engagement signal, a micro-commitment, and a warm opener all in one. The deal starts there.

**Proven result:** This exact approach was used to land a $15k web design client (Indie Hackers case study). Reply rate: 2–10% depending on lead quality.

### 3. The Specific Observations Approach

Name 2-3 exact problems you noticed. Be so specific that the email couldn't have been sent to anyone else.

> "I noticed [Company]'s homepage doesn't have any client testimonials, the mobile layout breaks on the services page, and there's no clear CTA above the fold."

**Proven result:** Jake Jorgovan used this approach to close $12,030 in 7 months as a freelancer, sending ~100 emails per 1-2 jobs closed.

## Subject Lines

### What works

| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| Question | "Is [Company]'s website losing you clients?" |
| Specificity + curiosity | "3 things I noticed on [Company]'s homepage" |
| Outcome-led | "This could be your new website" |
| Implied audit | "Ideas & feedback for [CompanyName]" |
| Soft flattery | "You've checked mine so... I've checked yours" |
| Direct and short | "[City] search results — a gap I spotted" |

### Rules
- **4-7 words** is the sweet spot (especially for mobile)
- **Never hype words:** free, guaranteed, urgent, act now, limited time
- **Personalization lifts opens by 31%** — include the company name or city
- **Questions hit 46% open rate** — the highest of any format tested
- Avoid anything that sounds like a newsletter or broadcast

---

## Email Structure

### Optimal length: 100–200 words, 6–8 sentences

Research shows this range achieves the highest reply rate (6.9%) and open rate (42.67%). Shorter (under 50 words) looks lazy. Longer (200+) gets skimmed and ignored.

### The structure that works

```
[Opening line — specific observation about them, not about you]

[One sentence connecting that observation to a real cost or consequence]

[What you did / what you have for them]

[One-line proof or case study reference]

[Single, low-friction CTA]

[Sign off — name only, no logo, no long signature]
```

### The CTA hierarchy (lowest to highest friction)

| CTA | Friction | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| "Happy to send it over if useful?" | Very low | Loom/video offer |
| "Worth a quick look?" | Very low | Demo link |
| "Would a 10-min call make sense?" | Low | Warm follow-up |
| "Can I send over some thoughts?" | Low | First email |
| "Book a time here: [Calendly]" | Medium | Warm leads only |
| "Schedule a 45-minute strategy session" | High | Never in cold email |

**Always ask for the smallest possible next step.**

---

## The Follow-Up Sequence

> 55–58% of all replies come from follow-ups, not the first email.
> 31.5% of replies come specifically from email #2.
> A 4-email sequence gets 3x more replies than a 1-email sequence.

### Cadence: Day 0 / Day 3 / Day 10 / Day 17

This "3-7-7" pattern captures ~93% of total replies by Day 17.

---

**Email 1 — Day 0: The Observation + Hook**

Lead with your most specific observation. Deliver value upfront (demo link, Loom offer, or 3 specific findings). One low-friction CTA.

---

**Email 2 — Day 3: Nudge + New Value**

Short. Under 5 sentences. Bump the previous email but add something new — a case study result, a stat, a second observation. Do NOT repeat the same email verbatim.

> "Hi [Name] — just wanted to resurface this in case it got buried. I worked with [similar local business] recently and they saw a 30% uptick in form submissions within 6 weeks of going live. Happy to share the details if useful."

---

**Email 3 — Day 10: Reframe**

Change the angle entirely. Instead of leading with web design, lead with a question about their current situation. Get them thinking about the problem differently.

> "Hi [Name] — different question. Are you happy with how many people are actually booking through your site right now? I ask because [specific thing I noticed] suggests you might be leaving leads on the table. Worth a quick chat?"

---

**Email 4 — Day 17: The Breakup**

Counterintuitively one of the highest-performing emails. Signal you're moving on — creates urgency without pressure, removes the awkwardness of silence.

> "I'll take your silence as not the right time — totally get it, you're busy. I'll stop following up. If that ever changes, I'm at emory@kolider.digital. Either way, good luck with [specific thing about their business]."

---

**What NOT to say in follow-ups:**
- "Just checking in..." (adds zero value)
- "Did you get a chance to read my last email?" (passive, slightly guilt-tripping)
- Resending the identical email again

---

## Personalisation Framework

Personalisation in 2025 is not `{{first_name}}`. It's **relevance** — why does this email make sense for this specific person, right now?

### The triggers to look for (and use as email hooks)

| What to check | Tool | Hook example |
|---|---|---|
| Mobile layout broken | View on phone | "I checked on my phone and the layout breaks at..." |
| Slow load time | PageSpeed Insights | "Your homepage loads in 6.2 seconds — above the 3s bounce threshold" |
| Old tech stack | Wappalyzer / BuiltWith | "Still running on jQuery 1.x from 2016..." |
| Missing from local search | Google search | "Searched '[service] [city]' and couldn't find you on page 1" |
| No contact form | Manual check | "The only way to reach you is a phone number — you're losing leads" |
| Copyright year old | Check footer | "Copyright 2014 in the footer — makes the site look abandoned" |
| Competitor outranking them | Google search | "Your competitor [Name] is ranking above you for [term]" |
| No Google Business | Maps search | "No Google Business listing means you don't appear in maps searches" |
| No pricing/fees page | Manual check | "Clients want to know fees upfront — competitors who show pricing convert more" |

### The first sentence is everything

The single most important element of personalisation is the opening line. It must be so specific that the email could not have been sent to anyone else. Generic AI-written openers are detected and see **90% lower response rates.**

Bad: "I came across your website and noticed some areas that could be improved."
Good: "I noticed [Company]'s site doesn't show up when you search '[service] Camden' on mobile — it looks like the mobile layout might be the issue."

---

## What NOT to Do

1. **Lead with yourself** — "We're a full-service agency..." is the fastest way to get deleted
2. **Generic AI copy** — Prospects have seen it 50 times. If you use AI to draft, edit aggressively for specificity
3. **HTML email with images** — Cold outreach should look like a colleague's email, not a Mailchimp blast. Plain text only.
4. **Multiple links** — One link maximum. Zero links in the first email is often safer.
5. **Attachments** — PDFs trigger spam filters. Offer to send only after a reply.
6. **High-friction CTA** — Never ask for a 45-minute call in a cold email
7. **Stopping after one email** — You'll miss 55%+ of potential replies
8. **Spam words** — "free", "guaranteed", "click here", "act now", "no risk", "make money"
9. **BCC/CC multiple people** — Instant spam flag
10. **Sending from your main domain without warmup** — One spam complaint can blacklist it

## Deliverability Setup (Non-Negotiable)

Before sending a single cold email:

### 1. Get a dedicated sending domain
Never use your primary domain (kolider.digital) for cold outreach. Register a variant:
- koliderdigital.co.uk
- trykolider.com
- kolider.co

### 2. Authenticate it (all three)
- **SPF** — which mail servers can send from your domain
- **DKIM** — cryptographic proof the email wasn't tampered with (use 2048-bit key)
- **DMARC** — ties it together; start with `p=none`

Check with: MXToolbox.com or Mail-Tester.com

### 3. Warm up the domain (2-4 weeks minimum)
- Week 1-2: 10-20 emails/day to real people who'll open and reply
- Increase by 20/week
- Use a warmup service: Instantly, Mailreach, or Warmup Inbox
- Do NOT send cold emails until this is done

### 4. Safe daily limits
| Stage | Max per day |
|---|---|
| New domain (<30 days) | 20-30 |
| Warmed domain (30-90 days) | 50 |
| Established (90+ days) | 100 |

### 5. Keep metrics healthy
- Bounce rate: below 2% (verify emails with Hunter.io or NeverBounce first)
- Spam complaint rate: below 0.1% (Google's threshold is 0.3%)

### 6. Plain text format

Cold emails that land in Primary look like this:
- No logo in signature
- No HTML formatting
- No unsubscribe link (you're not doing newsletter marketing)
- No tracking pixel (remove open tracking for cold outreach — hurts deliverability)
- One link maximum
- Short, personal signature: name + email only

### Best sending times
- **Days:** Tuesday–Thursday
- **Times:** 8–10am or 2–4pm (prospect's local timezone)
- Avoid Monday morning and Friday afternoon

## WhatsApp / SMS

**Use as a follow-up channel only, never as the opener.**

### WhatsApp — works well in the UK

The UK is a high WhatsApp usage market. Small business owners in trades, legal, financial services often use it for business.

**When to use it:**
- As touchpoint 4 or 5, after email attempts
- Reference the email: "Hi [Name] — sent you an email last week about your website, wanted to make sure it landed"
- One message only. If no reply, do not follow up on WhatsApp.

**What to say:**
> "Hi [Name], I'm Emory from Kolider Digital. Sent you an email about [Company]'s website — I've built a demo version and wanted to make sure you saw it. Link: [URL]"

**Never:** attach unsolicited files, send long pitch messages, bulk message via WhatsApp Business API without opt-in (account ban).

### SMS

Not recommended for cold outreach in the UK/EU (GDPR requires consent for commercial SMS). Risk of spam reports outweighs potential upside.

---

## Reply Rate Benchmarks

| Metric | Average | Good | Excellent |
|---|---|---|---|
| Open rate | 27.7% | 35%+ | 50%+ |
| Reply rate | 5.1% | 8–10% | 15%+ |
| Inbox placement | ~83% | 90%+ | 95%+ |

Note: Open rates are increasingly unreliable (Apple Mail Privacy inflates them). **Reply rate is the only metric that matters.**

A 5–8% reply rate means your copy and targeting are solid. 10%+ means both are working.

---

## Email Templates (Research-Informed)

### Template 1: Live Demo (our primary approach)

**Subject:** This could be [Company]'s new website

> Hi [Name],
>
> I was searching for [service] in [area] and came across [Company] — I noticed the site hasn't been updated in a while, so I went ahead and built a modern version as a demo.
>
> You can see it here: [link]
>
> No obligation. I just find it easier to show what I mean than describe it.
>
> If you like it, I can take it live with your real details for a flat fee — no retainer, no ongoing costs unless you want hosting support.
>
> Worth a look?
>
> Emory
> Kolider Digital

---

### Template 2: Loom Audit Offer

**Subject:** 3 things I noticed on [Company]'s website

> Hi [Name],
>
> I came across [Company] while looking at [service] sites in [area]. I put together a quick 3-minute video looking at your site — no pitch, just a few specific things I noticed that could be easy wins.
>
> Happy to send it over if useful?
>
> Emory
> Kolider Digital

---

### Template 3: Specific Observations

**Subject:** Ideas & feedback for [Company]

> Hi [Name],
>
> I had a look at [Company]'s website and noticed a few things: [specific issue 1], [specific issue 2], and [specific issue 3].
>
> I recently helped [similar type of business] fix exactly these issues — they had a new site live within 3 weeks and saw a significant increase in enquiries.
>
> Would a quick chat be worth it?
>
> Emory
> Kolider Digital

---

### Template 4: Follow-up #2 (Day 3)

> Hi [Name] — just resurfacing this in case it got buried.
>
> I recently helped [similar business type] in [city] modernise their site — they booked [X new clients / saw X% more enquiries] in the first 6 weeks. Happy to share the details if useful.
>
> Emory

---

### Template 5: The Breakup (Day 17)

> Hi [Name] — I'll take your silence as not the right time, and that's completely fine.
>
> I'll stop reaching out. If that ever changes, I'm at emory@kolider.digital.
>
> Good luck with [specific thing about their business — their Mayfair office / their #1 search ranking / their Chartered status].
>
> Emory
