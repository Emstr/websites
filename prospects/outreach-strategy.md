# Kolider Digital — Prospecting Strategy

Last updated: February 2026

---

## The Core Approach

1. **Find** a business with an outdated website
2. **Build** a personalised demo (clone existing template, swap their name/details)
3. **Send** the link cold — "I built this for you, take a look"
4. **Close** with a fixed-price offer (£500–£1500 depending on prospect)

The demo does the selling. Don't ask for work — show it already done.

## Pivot Rule

> **10 outreaches with no reply in 3 days = pivot to next vertical**

Don't grind a dead vertical. Move fast. Each vertical gets one focused push.

## 30 Business Types — Ranked by Confidence

| # | Business Type | Confidence | Why |
|---|---------------|-----------|-----|
| 1 | Notary publics | 9/10 | Tiny niche, terrible sites, motivated (ranking = revenue) |
| 2 | Independent financial advisers | 8/10 | Credibility gap = strong pitch, high-value clients |
| 3 | Osteopaths / chiropractors | 8/10 | Booking-driven, most sites are ancient, clear ROI |
| 4 | Dentists (private/cosmetic) | 8/10 | High fees, clients judge by first impression, image matters |
| 5 | Immigration solicitors | 8/10 | Huge demand, typically terrible sites, high urgency clients |
| 6 | Physiotherapists (private) | 7/10 | Same profile as osteopaths, booking-focused |
| 7 | Personal injury solicitors | 7/10 | High-value leads, sites often look like 2005 |
| 8 | Estate agents (independent) | 7/10 | Competitive market, outdated players easy to spot |
| 9 | Letting agents (boutique) | 7/10 | Same as estate agents, landlord-facing |
| 10 | Mortgage brokers | 7/10 | Referral-heavy but sites still matter, FCA badge pitch works |
| 11 | Accountants (SME-focused) | 7/10 | High trust service, outdated sites common, recurring clients |

| 15 | Event venues (small/private) | 6/10 | Booking-driven, high season urgency |
| 16 | Plasterers / builders (premium) | 6/10 | Mid-market trades want to look professional for big jobs |
| 17 | Interior designers | 6/10 | Visual business but surprisingly bad sites |
| 18 | Architects (small practice) | 6/10 | Visual portfolio, slow to modernise |
| 19 | Driving instructors (franchise) | 6/10 | Volume business, basic sites, booking = revenue |
| 20 | Vets (private / boutique) | 6/10 | Pet owners are loyal, trust-driven |
| 21 | Opticians (independent) | 6/10 | vs. Specsavers — local SEO pitch |
| 22 | Private GP clinics | 6/10 | High-value, growing market, old sites |
| 23 | Nutritionists / dietitians | 5/10 | Growing demand, easy to clone template |
| 24 | Life coaches / executive coaches | 5/10 | Personal brand sites, many look DIY |
| 25 | Martial arts / fitness studios | 5/10 | Membership model, booking-focused |
| 26 | IT support companies (SME) | 5/10 | B2B, high LTV, sites often neglected |
| 27 | Recruitment agencies (niche) | 5/10 | B2B, credibility pitch, long sales cycle |

## Email Templates

### Template A — Generic "I built your site" cold email

**Subject:** I rebuilt your website — take a look

> Hi [Name],
>
> I'm Emory from Kolider Digital. I came across [business name] while researching [notaries / financial advisers / etc.] in London.
>
> I went ahead and built a modern version of your website as a demo — you can see it here:
> **[Kolider demo URL]**
>
> No obligation at all. I just find it easier to show what I mean rather than describe it.
>
> If you like it and want to talk about taking it live with your real details, I charge a flat fee of £[X] — that's it, no monthly retainer.
>
> Worth a quick chat?
>
> Emory
> Kolider Digital
> emory@kolider.digital

### Template B — Notary specific

**Subject:** Your website is ranking #1 — but losing bookings

> Hi [Name],
>
> I noticed [Business Name] is ranking at the top of Google for "[notary public Camden]" — that's great SEO. But I also noticed the site hasn't been updated in a while, and most visitors will bounce before they contact you.
>
> I built a modernised demo to show you what it could look like:
> **[Kolider demo URL]**
>
> Features:
> - Mobile-friendly (60%+ of searches are on phones)
> - Instant quote calculator
> - Clear pricing page
> - Simple contact form
>
> Happy to take this live for £[X] — flat fee, done in a week.
>
> Want to take a look?
>
> Emory
> Kolider Digital

### Template C — Financial adviser specific

**Subject:** Your Mayfair office deserves a better website

> Hi [Name],
>
> I came across [Business Name] while researching independent financial advisers in London. You clearly have strong credentials — but your website doesn't reflect that.
>
> For clients trusting you with their money, first impressions online matter more than people think.
>
> I built a demo of what a modern version could look like:
> **[Kolider demo URL]**
>
> I specialise in building websites for financial services firms — clean, FCA-compliant, mobile-first, and built to convert.
>
> Flat fee of £[X]. No ongoing costs unless you want hosting support.
>
> Emory
> Kolider Digital

---

### Template D — WhatsApp / SMS follow-up (3 days after email)

> Hey [Name], Emory here from Kolider Digital. Sent you an email a few days ago about a new website demo I built for you. Just wanted to make sure it didn't land in spam — worth 2 mins to look? [link]

## GEO Pitch Points

When prospects ask "what's GEO?":

> "Google is still important, but more and more people are now asking ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Google's AI Overview to recommend services. Those AI tools pull from well-structured websites with clear text. If your site is outdated, slow, or hard to read — the AI won't recommend you. We build sites that get found by both Google and AI search."
