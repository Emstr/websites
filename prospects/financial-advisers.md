## Southern England & Wales Prospects (February 2026)

### 9. Gillinghams Independent Financial Advisers Ltd
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Website | https://www.gillinghamsifa.co.uk |
| Owner | Gillinghams Independent Financial Advisers Ltd |
| Phone | 01308 425 962 |
| Email | Via contact form (gillinghamsifa.co.uk/contact.php) |
| Location | 2 Victoria Grove, Bridport, Dorset, DT6 3AA |
| Services | Investments, retirement planning, care planning, protection, advice for individuals, companies, trustees |
| FCA Number | 609295 |
| Rating | 3/10 |
| Issues | Old PHP-based site with .php file extensions in URLs (aboutus.php, contact.php, private-clients.php). Uses MooTools (a JavaScript framework last popular in 2008-2012, now effectively dead). No modern CMS. Basic flat HTML/PHP page structure. Minimal searchable content. Design is text-heavy and dated. Family firm established since 1908 but website feels circa 2010. |
| Pitch Angle | 116-year-old Dorset firm with serious heritage but a website stuck in 2010. MooTools is extinct tech. Their competitors have modern, trust-building sites. A fresh build would honour their legacy properly. |

### 10. Pembrokeshire Financial Services
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Website | http://pfs-ifa.com |
| Owner | Pembrokeshire Financial Services |
| Phone | 01646 687767 |
| Email | Via website contact form |
| Location | Pembroke, Wales (serves Cardiff, Newport, Swansea, Bridgend, Haverfordwest, Port Talbot, Tenby) |
| Services | Independent financial advice, mortgage advice across Wales |
| Rating | 2/10 |
| Issues | Still on HTTP (no SSL/HTTPS) -- a massive red flag for a financial services firm. Built by "DM Web Solutions" (a small local provider, not a specialist). Minimal indexable content suggests heavy reliance on images/non-standard HTML rather than modern SEO-friendly text. No modern responsive framework evident. Extremely sparse web presence in search results. The URL itself (pfs-ifa.com) is unmemorable. |
| Pitch Angle | A financial adviser with NO SSL certificate in 2026 is a trust-killer. Google Chrome literally shows "Not Secure" in the address bar. Clients are being asked to trust this firm with their life savings while the browser warns them the site isn't safe. Easy sell. |

### 11. ABS Financial Planning
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Website | https://www.absfinancial.co.uk |
| Owner | ABS Financial Planning Ltd (Director: Graham Shields) |
| Phone | 023 8033 3099 |
| Email | advice@absfinancial.co.uk |
| Location | 184 Portswood Road, Portswood, Southampton, SO17 2NJ |
| Services | Private client financial advice, small business advice, pensions, investments, protection, mortgages |
| FCA Number | 150285 |
| Rating | 4/10 |
| Issues | Basic Bootstrap template site on Apache server. Static HTML pages (.html extensions visible). Simple brochure-style layout with minimal interactive elements. Founded 1991 with 125 years combined team experience but site looks like a basic template from 2014-2016. No modern lead capture, no booking system, no client portal. Stock imagery. Desktop-focused design. |
| Pitch Angle | 30+ year Southampton firm with 125 years combined experience, but their website is a basic Bootstrap template. High-net-worth Portswood/Southampton clients expect more polish from their financial adviser. |

### 12. Castle Investment Consultants
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Website | https://castle-investments.com |
| Owner | Widelist Investments Ltd trading as Castle Investment Consultants |
| Phone | 023 8087 3187 |
| Email | info@castle-investments.com (also katherine@, roger@, liz@, david@, jane@, mike@ castle-investments.com) |
| Location | 19/21 Junction Road, Totton, Southampton, Hants, SO40 9HG |
| Services | Whole-of-market independent financial advice, pensions, investments, mortgages, protection, estate planning |
| FCA Registered | Yes |
| Rating | 3.5/10 |
| Issues | Minimal single-page or very basic layout. Contact information displayed in a rudimentary format. Simple, template-based or possibly static website. Established 1986 with 6+ consultants but the web presence is severely underwhelming. Totton's oldest IFA deserves better. No modern features (booking, client portal, testimonials, team bios with photos). |
| Pitch Angle | 40-year heritage firm with 6 consultants, freehold premises, and a strong local reputation -- but the website looks like it was built by a nephew in 2012. Every competitor in Southampton looks more credible online. |

### 13. Beckworth Financial Services Ltd
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Website | https://www.beckworthifa.co.uk |
| Owner | Beckworth Financial Services Ltd (Founder: Jonathan Wadsworth) |
| Phone | 01392 678 555 |
| Email | Via website contact form |
| Location | 30 Southernhay East, Exeter, Devon, EX1 1NS |
| Services | Pension management, investment strategies, asset management, portfolio management, care home resident capital management, bespoke insurance |
| FCA Number | 430007 |
| Rating | 4/10 |
| Issues | Small, dated brochure site. Founded 2001 with 28+ years experience but the website doesn't reflect their expertise. Minimal content for SEO. Basic design with limited interactivity. No modern lead generation tools. Site appears to have limited mobile optimization. "Hands on" approach to money management not reflected in an engaging online presence. |
| Pitch Angle | Exeter firm specialising in care home capital management (niche expertise!) but their website doesn't showcase this specialism at all. A proper site could own the "care home financial planning Devon" search space. |

### 14. Fairway Independent Financial Advisers Ltd
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Website | https://fairway-ifa.co.uk |
| Owner | Fairway Independent Financial Advisers Ltd |
| Phone | Via website |
| Email | Via website contact form |
| Location | Fairway House, 127 Walton Road, East Molesey, Surrey, KT8 0DT (near Hampton Court) |
| Services | Investment advice, equity release, mortgages, business insurance, taxation, protection, wealth management, pensions |
| FCA Number | 737373 |
| Rating | 3.5/10 |
| Issues | Basic brochure-style website. Directors have 65+ years combined experience but site is a simple informational page. Very small team (1 adviser, 1 mortgage broker) so the website needs to punch above its weight -- it doesn't. Generic design, minimal content, no client testimonials, no thought leadership content. |
| Pitch Angle | Prime Surrey location near Hampton Court (affluent area) with 65+ years combined experience but a website that looks like it cost nothing. Their wealthy Surrey clients expect high-end presentation. |

### 15. City Financial Planning Limited
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Website | https://www.cityfinancialplanning.co.uk |
| Owner | City Financial Planning Limited |
| Phone | 01225 314999 |
| Email | admin@cityfinancialplanning.co.uk |
| Location | 3 Princes Building, George Street, Bath, BANES, BA1 2ED |
| Services | Insurance, pensions, mortgages, life cover, investments & savings, equity release, health & long term care, corporate financial advice, estate planning |
| FCA Registered | Yes (Company No. 03224580) |
| Rating | 4/10 |
| Issues | Basic IFA template website. Located on prestigious George Street in Bath but site doesn't reflect the premium location. Minimal interactive features. Standard brochure layout. No modern design elements. Their broad service offering (9+ service areas) is poorly presented -- should have dedicated landing pages for each. |
| Pitch Angle | George Street, Bath is premium real estate. The website should match the address. Clients walking past the office expect a digital presence that matches the Georgian elegance of their physical location. |

### 16. Stiles & Company Financial Services Ltd
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Website | https://www.stilesfinancial.co.uk |
| Owner | Stiles & Company Financial Services Ltd |
| Phone | 01273 736713 |
| Email | advice@stilesfinancial.co.uk |
| Location | 2 Amber House, St John's Road, Hove, BN3 2EZ (also Taplow, Maidenhead office) |
| Services | Life assurance, pensions, investments, financial planning |
| Rating | 4/10 |
| Issues | Older-style website with PHP contact form (contact.php). Two-office firm but web presence doesn't reflect the scale. Brighton & Hove is a competitive IFA market with many modern-looking competitors. Basic layout and design. Limited content. No modern lead generation or booking functionality. |
| Pitch Angle | Brighton & Hove is full of design-savvy professionals who judge businesses by their website. Stiles has the experience but their online presence is losing them clients to slicker competitors down the road. |

### 17. Cornerstone Financial Planning
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Website | https://www.cornerstoneifa.co.uk |
| Owner | Simon Neal (established 1992) |
| Phone | 01865 241199 |
| Email | Via website contact form |
| Location | 11 Minster Road, Oxford, Oxfordshire, OX4 1LX |
| Services | Boutique investment and financial planning service |
| FCA Registered | Yes |
| Rating | 4/10 |
| Issues | Boutique Oxford firm established 1992 (34 years!) but the website is basic. Minimal design that lacks the depth expected from a 3-decade firm. Limited content pages. No blog or thought leadership. Oxford is a highly educated, research-driven city -- clients will Google extensively before choosing an IFA. Thin content means poor SEO. |
| Pitch Angle | Oxford clients are academics, tech professionals, and researchers. They'll research their IFA thoroughly online. A thin website with minimal content loses to competitors with in-depth guides, calculators, and thought leadership. 34 years of expertise deserves a proper digital showcase. |

### 18. DWJ Wealth Management Ltd
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Website | https://www.dwjwealth.co.uk |
| Owner | DWJ Wealth Management Ltd (CEO: Danni Watts-Jones) |
| Phone | 01639 825066 |
| Email | info@dwjwealth.co.uk |
| Location | Argyle House, 10 West Street, Gorseinon, Swansea, SA4 4AA |
| Services | Tailored wealth management, private and corporate client advice, equity release |
| FCA Registered | Yes (Company No. 09104954) |
| Rating | 4/10 |
| Issues | Basic website for a firm that serves both private and corporate clients. Limited online presence. Site doesn't adequately convey their wealth management capabilities. No interactive tools or modern design elements. Swansea area has limited IFA competition online -- opportunity to dominate local search with a proper site. |
| Pitch Angle | Swansea has fewer IFA competitors online than London -- a well-built, SEO-optimised site could put DWJ at the top of every local search. First-mover advantage in a less competitive market. |

### 19. Heaton Financial
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Website | https://www.heatonfinancial.co.uk |
| Owner | Heaton Financial Independent Financial Advisers Ltd |
| Phone | 01392 258252 |
| Email | info@heatonfinancial.co.uk |
| Location | 6 Waring Bowen Court, Mill Road, Exeter, EX2 6LY |
| Services | Investments & ISAs, savings, pensions & annuities, life assurance, income protection, inheritance tax planning, specialist advice for medical professionals |
| FCA Registered | Yes |
| Rating | 4.5/10 |
| Issues | Basic brochure website. Has a valuable niche (medical professionals) but the site doesn't target this audience specifically. No dedicated landing page for doctors/NHS staff. Generic design that doesn't differentiate from competitors. Limited content for SEO. Could be ranking for "financial adviser for doctors Exeter" but isn't. |
| Pitch Angle | Specialist medical professional niche is gold -- but the website doesn't target it. A dedicated "Financial Advice for Doctors" landing page would capture high-value search traffic that no Exeter competitor is going after. |

### 20. Sussex Independent Financial Advisers Ltd
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Website | https://www.sussexifa.com |
| Owner | Sussex Independent Financial Advisers Ltd |
| Phone | 01323 441788 |
| Email | reception@sussexifa.com |
| Location | Downford House, 16 George Street, Hailsham, East Sussex, BN27 1AE |
| Services | Investments, pensions, mortgages, life cover, insurance, will writing |
| FCA Registered | Yes (Company No. 4117727) |
| Rating | 3.5/10 |
| Issues | Website data is compiled by "Adviser Portals Ltd" -- a third-party template platform for IFAs (not custom-built). Generic template design shared with many other IFA firms. No unique branding or differentiation. Limited content. The firm has multiple advisers and a will-writing service but the template restricts how these are presented. Planned features (secure policy viewing) still marked as "coming soon" -- suggests the site has been neglected. |
| Pitch Angle | Using a generic Adviser Portals template means their site looks identical to dozens of other IFAs. In Sussex, where several competitors have invested in custom sites, this makes them invisible. A custom site would finally let their team personalities and 20+ years of experience shine through. |

### 21. Abacus Financial Options
| Field | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Website | https://www.abacusfinancialoptions.co.uk |
| Owner | Abacus Financial Options Ltd |
| Phone | 01202 646960 |
| Email | enquiries@abacusfinancialoptions.co.uk |
| Location | Forest Links Road, Ferndown, Dorset, BH22 9PH |
| Services | Mortgages, investments, pensions, life assurance, income protection, business protection, retirement planning |
| FCA Registered | Yes (incorporated 2011) |
| Rating | 4/10 |
| Issues | Basic brochure site serving clients across Dorset, Wiltshire, Somerset, Hampshire, London, and Cornwall but the web presence doesn't reflect this geographic reach. Limited content depth. No modern design elements. Competing in the crowded Bournemouth/Dorset IFA market without a distinctive online presence. |
| Pitch Angle | Serving 6 counties but the website looks like a local one-man band. A site that showcases their multi-county reach with location-specific landing pages would capture significantly more search traffic. |

| Region | Glasgow / Lanarkshire / Central Scotland |
| FCA Number | 758771 |
| Rating | 3/10 |
| Issues | Uses ancient .shtml file extensions (Server Side Includes from the early 2000s), static HTML architecture, no modern CMS, multiple pages with inconsistent naming conventions (financialadvisorscotland.shtml, financialadvisorcoatbridge.shtml), dated design aesthetic, likely zero mobile optimisation, no modern interactive elements or client portal |
| Pitch Angle | Father-and-son firm with 40+ years experience but a website stuck in 2005 - .shtml pages scream "we built this ourselves 20 years ago". Clients comparing them to modern IFA sites will lose confidence immediately |

### 23. Independent Financial Solutions (IFS)

| Region | Preston, Lancashire |
| Rating | 3.5/10 |
| Issues | Copyright footer stuck at 2016, uses .php file extensions suggesting custom/legacy PHP build, website clearly not updated in years, no evidence of modern design framework, dated content management approach, established 2001 but web presence frozen in mid-2010s |
| Pitch Angle | Premier IFA firm in Preston established since 2001 but their website copyright says 2016 - a full decade without updates. Clients checking their site before a first meeting will question whether the firm is still active |

### 24. Buchanan Johnston Flynn Limited (MoneyHelp)

| Region | Belfast, Northern Ireland |
| FCA Number | 175588 (via 2plan, ref 461598) |
| Rating | 4/10 |
| Issues | Basic template website via 2plan wealth management platform, limited customisation, generic IFA template design shared with hundreds of other 2plan advisers, no unique branding or differentiation, standard stock imagery, minimal personality or trust-building content, domain name (moneyhelp.co.uk) confusable with government MoneyHelper service |
| Pitch Angle | Established in 1995, nearly 30 years of expertise, but using a cookie-cutter 2plan template website identical to hundreds of other advisers. Their domain "moneyhelp.co.uk" is also confusable with the government's MoneyHelper - they need a distinctive web presence |

### 25. Sean McCabe Financial Adviser Ltd

| Issues | Small family-run firm since 2006 with a basic, dated website, minimal web presence, simple layout with limited content, no modern design elements, likely no mobile optimisation, basic stock imagery, no client testimonials or trust signals beyond FCA registration |
| Pitch Angle | Family-run firm handling people's life savings with a website that looks like it was built when they incorporated in 2006. Free initial consultations are great but the website gives no reason to book one |

### 26. Derbyshire Independent Financial Advisers LLP

| Region | Derby / Derbyshire |
| FCA Number | 624915 |
| Rating | 4/10 |
| Issues | Operates from a residential-looking village address, basic website lacking modern design, minimal content depth, no evidence of modern CMS or responsive framework, over 100 years combined experience claim but website does not reflect professional calibre, limited online presence |
| Pitch Angle | A firm with 100+ years of combined experience operating from a village address - the website needs to project professionalism and trust to compensate for not being in a city-centre office |

| Services | Investment advice, retirement planning, inheritance tax planning, cost reduction, whole-of-market independent advice |
| Region | Derby / Derbyshire |
| Rating | 4/10 |
| Issues | Uses a .net domain (unusual for a financial firm, suggests early web era registration), incorporated 2004, website design has not kept pace, basic layout, Pride Park business address but website undermines the professional image, no modern interactive elements |
| Pitch Angle | Fully independent IFA (whole of market access) in a smart Derby business park but the .net domain and dated design make them look like a hobby project. Clients in Pride Park offices expect polished suppliers |

### 28. Structured Financial Planning Ltd

| Services | Pensions, savings & investments, protection (life cover, income protection, critical illness), financial planning |
| Region | Aberdeen / Banff / North East Scotland |
| Rating | 4.5/10 |
| Issues | Basic WordPress or template site, small-town feel to the design, limited visual impact, multiple office locations but the website does not convey scale or professionalism, likely poor mobile experience, community sponsorship content (golf club, football) takes prominence over services |
| Pitch Angle | Five office locations across North East Scotland but a website that looks like a single-adviser operation. Director has 25+ years experience and advanced qualifications - the site should showcase this credibility |

### 29. HSP Financial Planning Ltd

| Issues | Established 1977 but website feels stuck in the 2010s, includes a "useful financial planning websites" links page (a relic of early web design), likely old WordPress or template build, team has 100+ years combined experience but site does not communicate authority, suburban office location needs strong web presence to attract clients |
| Pitch Angle | Nearly 50 years in business with 100+ years of combined team experience - but their website still has a "useful links" page like it is 2005. A firm this established deserves a site that matches their legacy |

| Issues | Excessively long domain name (financialadvisernorthernireland.com) is unprofessional and hard to remember, basic template website, claims to be media experts (Belfast Telegraph, Downtown Radio) but the website does not reflect media-savviness, generic design lacking personality, email domain (fpni.co.uk) does not match website domain |
| Pitch Angle | They contribute to the Belfast Telegraph and Downtown Radio as financial experts but their own website looks like a basic template. If they can be trusted on radio, their site should exude that same authority |

| Region | Newry, Northern Ireland |
| FCA Number | 702579 |
| Rating | 4.5/10 |
| Issues | 40+ years trading but basic website, email domain (digneygrant.co.uk) differs from website domain (digneygrantfp.com) creating brand confusion, two separate addresses for insurance vs financial planning suggest fragmented online presence, only 2 advisers and 2 mortgage brokers - small team with limited web investment, likely template or basic WordPress site |
| Pitch Angle | Over 40 years as a one-stop shop for insurance and financial planning in Newry - but the website does not convey that heritage. Two different domains and two addresses is confusing for clients trying to find them |

|-------|---------|
| Website | https://rmi-ifa.co.uk |
| Owner | Readymoney Investments Limited (trading as RMI) |

| Region | Market Harborough / Leicestershire / Midlands |
| FCA Number | 925064 |
| Rating | 4.5/10 |
| Issues | Trading name (RMI) differs from legal entity (Readymoney Investments) creating brand confusion, 50+ years of experience but website does not project that history, Market Harborough location (affluent area) but site looks like a basic IFA template, email uses personal name rather than generic inbox suggesting informality |
| Pitch Angle | 50+ years of independent advice in affluent Market Harborough but the website does not match the wealth of the local client base. "Readymoney Investments" is a memorable company name being wasted behind "RMI" |

| Region | Stirling / Central Scotland |
| Rating | 5/10 |
| Issues | Decent domain name but website likely using a basic WordPress template, serving multiple areas (Stirling, Falkirk, Dunblane, Fife, West Lothian) but site may not effectively target each locality for SEO, divorce planning specialism is a strong USP not being fully leveraged online, Castle Business Park address is professional but site may not match |
| Pitch Angle | Divorce planning and pension transfer specialists in Central Scotland - these are high-value, high-emotion services that need a website inspiring confidence and empathy, not a template |
