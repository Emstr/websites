## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does it cost to notarise a document in the UK?
The minimum fee is £80 (no VAT) for up to twenty minutes of notary time. Pro-rata rates apply for longer appointments. Additional factors affecting cost include the number of documents, whether legalisation or apostille services are needed, complexity, and whether a home or business visit is required.

### What services does a notary public offer in Islington?

For businesses: powers of attorney, certificates of incorporation, commercial contracts, affidavits, and intellectual property documentation. For individuals: certified copies of passports, powers of attorney, statutory declarations, single status declarations for marriage abroad, and academic credential certification.

### How do I get a document notarised in the UK?
1. Contact a notary public to discuss requirements and receive a quote
2. Gather required documents: original document(s), government-issued photo ID, proof of address
3. Attend appointment where the notary verifies identity, witnesses signature, and applies official seal
4. If required, arrange legalisation via Apostille (FCDO) or embassy legalisation

### Is a notary the same as a solicitor?
No. A notary public is a highly specialised legal professional focused on authenticating documents for international use, appointed by the Court of Faculties of the Archbishop of Canterbury. A solicitor provides general legal advice and representation, regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. You typically need a notary when documents must be used abroad.

### What is an Apostille?
An Apostille is a certificate issued by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) that authenticates the origin of a notarised document. Required when documents will be used in Hague Apostille Convention member countries. Non-Hague countries require embassy or consulate legalisation instead.

### What is the difference between legalisation and notarisation?
Notarisation is performed by a notary public who verifies identity, witnesses signatures, and certifies documents. Legalisation is the subsequent step where government bodies (FCDO for Apostille, or embassies) verify the notary's credentials. Legalisation confirms to foreign authorities that the notary is legitimate and recognised.

### What identification do I need to bring?
Personal ID: valid passport, UK driving licence, or national identity card. Proof of address: utility bill, bank statement, or council tax bill dated within 3 months. Corporate clients also need certificate of incorporation, articles of association, and board resolution.

### How long does notarisation take?
Simple document certification: 15-20 minutes. Powers of attorney: 30-45 minutes. Corporate documentation: 30-60 minutes or more. Apostille takes 2-5 working days (standard service). Embassy legalisation varies by embassy, typically 1-4 weeks.

### Can a notary come to my home or office?
Yes. Home and business visits are available throughout Islington and surrounding London boroughs for an additional fee. Evening and weekend appointments can be arranged when necessary.
