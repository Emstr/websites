A notary public in Camden offers document authentication and certification services for both businesses and individuals. For businesses: powers of attorney, company document authentication, commercial mortgages, and banking documentation. For individuals: certified copies of passports, powers of attorney, statutory declarations, marriage capacity certificates, and academic credential certification.

### How do I get a document notarised in the UK?
1. Contact a notary public to discuss requirements and receive a quote
2. Gather required documents: original document(s), government-issued photo ID, proof of address
3. Attend appointment where the notary verifies identity, witnesses signature, and applies official seal
4. If required, arrange legalisation via Apostille (FCDO) or embassy legalisation

### Is a notary the same as a solicitor?
No. A notary public is a highly specialised legal professional focused on authenticating documents for international use, appointed by the Court of Faculties of the Archbishop of Canterbury. A solicitor provides general legal advice and representation, regulated by the Solicitors Regulation Authority. You typically need a notary when documents must be used abroad.

### What is an Apostille?
An Apostille is a certificate issued by the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) that authenticates the origin of a notarised document. Required when documents will be used in Hague Apostille Convention member countries. Non-Hague countries require embassy or consulate legalisation instead.

### What is the difference between legalisation and notarisation?
Notarisation is performed by a notary public who verifies identity, witnesses signatures, and certifies documents. Legalisation is the subsequent step where government bodies (FCDO for Apostille, or embassies) verify the notary's credentials. Legalisation confirms to foreign authorities that the notary is legitimate and recognised.

### What identification do I need to bring?
Personal ID: valid passport, UK driving licence, or national identity card. Proof of address: utility bill, bank statement, or council tax bill dated within 3 months. Corporate clients also need certificate of incorporation, articles of association, and board resolution.

### How long does notarisation take?
Simple document certification: 15-20 minutes. Powers of attorney: 30-45 minutes. Corporate documentation: 30-60 minutes or more. Apostille takes approximately 3 working days (standard service). Embassy legalisation varies by embassy, typically 1-4 weeks.

### Can a notary come to my home or office?
Yes. Home and office visits are available throughout Camden, Central London, and surrounding areas for an additional fee. Evening and weekend appointments can be arranged when necessary.
